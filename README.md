## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Hi! I'm Dhatri - a software engineer. I just graduated from UPenn with a degree in  Networked and Social Systems Engineering. If you're interested, check out some of my pinned projects/my own repositories. I have experience coding in Python, Java, Ruby, R, SQL, C# and GraphQL, but I'm always ready to learn something new :)
    
#### **Some Things I Did in College:**
    - Learned about software development through a club called Penn Spark:)
    - Joined a business frat called Phi Chi Theta and served as a wellness chair with my best friend
    - Worked part-time as a TA for two classes: NETS 2120: Scalable and Cloud Computing & CIS 5210: Artificial Intelligence
    
#### **Other Things I Love:**
    - Ice cream:) My favorite flavor is birthday cake, but I'm always looking for new ones to try!
    - Instant Pot Recipes
    - Puzzles
