## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Hi! I'm Dhatri - a software engineer. I just graduated from UPenn with a degree in  Networked and Social Systems Engineering. My major sounds like a jumble of words so here's a quick breakdown of what's involved: 

    - computer science
    - math
    - econ
    - data science

It's really interesting, and I'm always down to talk about it:)

#### **Some Things I Did in College:**
    - Learned about software development through a club called Penn Spark:)
    - Joined a business frat called Phi Chi Theta and served as a wellness chair with my best friend
    - Worked part-time as a TA for two classes: NETS 2120: Scalable and Cloud Computing & CIS 5210: Artificial Intelligence
    
#### **Things I Love:**
    - Ice cream:) My favorite flavor is birthday cake, but I'm always looking for new ones to try!
    - Instant Pot Recipes
    - Rom-Coms
    - Puzzles/reading <3
    - The color periwinkle
