## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Hi! I'm Dhatri - a senior studying Networked and Social Systems Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. My major sounds like a jumble of words so here's a quick breakdown of what's involved: 

    - computer science
    - math
    - econ
    - data science

It's really interesting, and I'm always down to talk about it:)

#### **Outside of School:**
    - I'm currently learning about software development through a club called Penn Spark:)
    - I'm part of a business frat called Phi Chi Theta and serve as a wellness chair with my friend Lauren!
    - I work part-time as a TA for a class called NETS 2120: Scalable and Cloud Computing & worked as a TA for 
    CIS 5210: Artificial Intelligence last semester.
    
#### **Things I enjoy:**
    - Ariana Grande/Taylor Swift - but please give me new music recs
    - ice cream:) My favorite flavor is birthday cake, but I'm always looking for new ones to try!
    - Exploring philly 
    - Amateur cooking
    - Rom-Coms
    - Puzzles/reading <3
    - the color periwinkle
