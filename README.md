## Hi! I'm Dhatri ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm a software engineer who recently graduated from UPenn with a degree in [Networked and Social Systems Engineering](https://www.nets.upenn.edu/). 

If you're interested, check out some of my pinned projects below or [my own repositories](https://github.com/dmed31?tab=repositories). I have experience coding in **Python, Java, Ruby, R, SQL, C# and GraphQL**, but I'm always ready to learn something new! :woman_technologist:

#### Feel free to message/reach me on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhatrim/)! Always down to chat :)
